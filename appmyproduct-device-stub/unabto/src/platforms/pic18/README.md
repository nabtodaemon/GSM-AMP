PIC 18
======

Platform adapter for PIC 18 with embedded PHY. This code has been
tested together with the UDP module from the Microchip TCP/IP stack.

Test Level
----------

This code is not tested for each release. Creating a firmware for PIC
18 requires extensive testing since the PIC18 platform is very limited
and there are a lot of technicalities with memory banks etc.
