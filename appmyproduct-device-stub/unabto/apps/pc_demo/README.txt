 *  SDK demo on Microsoft Windows and Unix (Linux or MAC OSX).
 *  This is the smallest possible implementation of uNabto.
 *
 *  The default HTML-DD source for this uNabto application is
 *  located at unabto/demo/html_device_driver, which also is a
 *  good starting point for creating your own custom HTML-DD.
 *  
 *  Manage your devices and read the quick start guide from
 *  https://portal.nabto.com
